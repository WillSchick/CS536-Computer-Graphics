# CS536-Computer-Graphics

## Course Objective
###### *Pasted from syllabus)*
Computer Graphics represents a vast technical field, ranging from mathematics and geometry topics to computer hardware and software engineering topics to rendering, animation and virtual reality, far more material than can be comprehensively covered in a 10 week term. CS 536 Computer Graphics is designed to provide graduate students with an introduction to the geometric modeling aspects of computer graphics, as well as the related topic of transformations. Course material will cover the various representations for 3D curves, surfaces and solids, and will also discuss the creation of complex, hierarchical models. Material on general topics in computer graphics, e.g. drawing/clipping algorithms, color, viewing and rendering, will also be interspersed throughout the class in order to expand its coverage.
